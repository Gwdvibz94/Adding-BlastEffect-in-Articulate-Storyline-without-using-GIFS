Hello all, 

I came across queries regarding how to add Confetti Blast effects on Articulate Storyline in the discussion forum on its official site. Guess what?
I got an answer to it. I have uploaded the zipped file named Confetti Blast . Please feel free to use the same in your products as well.

Happy Learning!
